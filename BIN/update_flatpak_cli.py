"""Flatpak CLI Shortcut Generator

https://gist.github.com/ssokolow/db565fd8a82d6002baada946adb81f68

A simple no-argument tool that generates launchers with traditional non-flatpak
command names for your installed Flatpak applications in ~/.local/bin/flatpak.

Does full collision detection and warns you if you forgot to add its output
directory to your PATH. Also overrules the command-line specified in the
``.desktop`` file if the Flatpak maintainer didn't include support for
command-line arguments.

Also includes some built-in mappings to compensate for the less desirable
launcher/wrapper names some Flatpak packages use.

Dependencies:
- Python 3.8+
- PyGobject (eg. python3-gi)
- Glib and Gio 2.0 with GIR bindings (eg. gir1.2-glib-2.0)
- Flatpak 1.0 GIR binding (eg. gir1.2-flatpak-1.0)

Known shortcomings:

* Doesn't recognize file:// URLs and `@@u` wrap them yet.
* Doesn't try parsing `--foo=/bar/baz` to find paths that need
  `--file-forwarding`, so use `--foo /bar/baz` instead.
* Still need to look into the best way to query the set of `.desktop` files
  installed by Things like OpenRA so I don't need to *manually* amend the
  `EXTRA_COMMANDS` list in cases involving secondary GUI apps.
* Uses the sledgehammer approach of just removing all non-folders from the
  target directory before generating new launchers to clear out stale entries.
  (A proper solution would keep track of which ones it created, but that'd
  require me to go back and implement detection of all prior versions which
  don't have a specific marker.)
* Doesn't solve the problem of flatpaks still not installing manpages
